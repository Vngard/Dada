## To run the application locally
  
  ## Install the Polymer-CLI

  First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve     your application locally.
  
  ## Building Your Application

  ```
  $ polymer build
  ```

  This will create builds of your application in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the       built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve from:

  ```
  $ polymer serve build/default
  ```

  ## Viewing Your Application

  ```
  $ polymer serve
  ```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
